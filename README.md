# PlpFinalProjectAugCohort
This is a database (MySQL) project that is aimed at informing farmers on good farming practices in line with SDG 2. It is aimed at ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture.


The database system will focus on collecting and delivering useful data about sustainable farming, crop management, pest control, irrigation practices, and farm management advice.

The database will contain information about:
1. Crops and their optimal farming practices
2. Weather and soil conditions
3. Pest and disease management
4. Farm resources (fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation systems)
5. Farmersâ€™ records and feedback
6. This system would provide farmers with data-driven advice on best practices, based on the type of crops they are growing and the environmental conditions they are facing.
